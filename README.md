# Most harmful storms

This repository contains an analysis of the most harmful storms in the U.S., and we aim to answer two questions:
1. What types of events have the most harmful impact on public health?
2. What types of events have the highest economic consequences on the population?

This project was part of a course on Reproducible Research in my Data Science specialization.
